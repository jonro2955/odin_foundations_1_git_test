# Git Test 
https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_foundations_1_git_test/

This is the first project in The Odin Project's "Foundations" Curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations 

The purpose of this project is to set up an empty HTML file with an empty CSS file and an empty JavaScript file linked together to serve as the starting point for future web projects. 

What I learned:

- Essential elements or tags required to create a basic HTML webpage.
- How to link a CSS style sheet and JS script file to a HTML file.
- Creating new repositories on Git and Github.
- Using the shell command line to clone, add, commit and push files onto Github.
